Our priority remains keeping our communities safe and healthy. In compliance with the Government Advisory to limit movement for reducing the spread of COVID-19, Uber services across India have been affected. This means that some or all of Uber services might not be available in your city. Please refer to the Uber page for the latest information on the status of Uber operations. This blog will be updated every few hours to ensure we are sharing all the necessary developments.

We request you to please follow the instructions of the public health authorities and use Uber only if absolutely essential.

Our hearts go out to everyone affected by COVID-19. We are taking extra precautions to keep our drivers and riders safe.
